        <h3  style="color:azure" class="my bio"> Hello! My name is Zeiad Alarkan. I'm 21 years old and I immigrated with my family to Canada when I was just 8 years old!
            I speak two languages at home, specifically english and arabic and my country of origin is Egypt. Other than persuing my academics, I currently work a part-time job
            at Canada Computers, and enjoy a few personal hobbies which are going to the gym, playing video games, reading a bit of manga and hanging out with my friends both in-person and online.
            In the future I hope to continue forth to become a networking specialist or a cybersecurity specialist. Know that you know a bit about me, I have also inlcluded a trailer for an upcoming Anime that I have been eagerly anticipating!
