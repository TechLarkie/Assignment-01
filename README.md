Dimensions used for each device 
phone: max width of 600px, this is due to the fact that many phones have screens which are 600px or less
tablet: min width of 601 px and a max width of 1024 - this takes into account small form factor tables all the way to tablets with screen sizes which are comparable to laptops
desktop: min width 1025, this takes into account screen sizes which are typically reserved for laptops and desktops


Usage of Linear Gradient:
Linear Gradient was used in the project page, specifically within the squares or 'pockets' as I called them which contain the title and brief summary about the projects which I worked on, I did this as I thought that this would add a nice styling choice
